Technologies Used: [Android App, Flask Server (Image Recognition, Image Processing, OCR)]
Smart Bill Manager is a solution to digitize the process of traditional bill management by providing an automated solution to scan, extract, store and manage bills.

This repository is the Front-End Android Application for Smart Bill Manager.
The purpose of this app is to allow users to take images of bills/receipts from their phones, send them to a remote server, and then receive relevant text information about those particular images eg. bill total, date, type of bill etc.
The text along with the image is stored in this app which the users can modify and add more information into.
The app also allows users to analyze past bills, view their stats and compare different bills.
Moreover there is an expense management module which allows users to manage their daily/ monthly/ yearly expenses.


HOW TO USE THE APP:
 1) Use Git clone or download the repository directly to a location in your storage. 
 2) Open the project in either Android Studio or IntelliJ.
 3) Allow for gradle to download resources and build.
 4) Run the project on an Android Emulator or on your Android phone (min version - v6)
 5) To use the functionality of OCR, the back-end server needs to be in running state.
 If you want to customize your own OCR for a particular bill image, then contact the dev team at:
